UCL HEP is one of the largest groups in the country with research areas spanning: theory/phenomenology, detector, software and accelerator R&D and analysis of data from the LHC, dark matter and neutrino experiments.



## AI Masterclass

Welcome to the UCL Artificial Intelligence masterclass! The aim of todayâ€™s event is to give you a flavour of how AI and data science are being used by physicists to push the boundaries of experimental physics and help us better understand the fundamental fabric of the universe.

You will hear from UCL and CERN physicist Dr Andy Bell about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the data science techniques used in studies of the Higgs boson. We will then split up into groups of 5 and work with the PhD mentors to develop a cut-based Higgs analysis that does not use artificial intelligence techniques. 
After this, The PhD mentors in your group will help you develop a neural network architecture to maximise the sensitivity to the Higgs signal found at the LHC. 

At the end of the day the we will be awarding a prize for the best cut-based analysis and the best neural network architecture presented by the Head of the Physics & Astronomy department at UCL. 

This is also an opportunity for you to meet university students and researchers. Throughout the day, feel free to ask any of us about anything related to university and we will do our best to answer your questions! 


## Get Started

To get started, download and unzip the resource file below:

- Download the resources for this tutorial here: <a href = ' https://github.com/ishank95/in2HEP/archive/master.zip' > Resource File </a>
- **Note: Make sure you unzip the file**

or using git from command line:

```
git clone https://ishank95.github.io/in2HEP/
```

- The tutorials are in the form of Jupyter notebooks and we will be using Python 3 throughout the exercises. To open a Jupyter notebook, type _Jupyter_ in the start menu and hit enter.

Or from the command line, navigate to the resource folder and type:
```
jupyter notebook
```

#### Python Crash Course (optional)
If you are not familiar with Python, please look at the Python Crash Course notebook first. If you are familiar with Python but have never used the pandas library before, it is worth looking at the _Introduction to Pandas_ section in the Crash Course notebook.

The easiest way to install Python on your own computers at home is to use the Anaconda Installer found here: https://www.anaconda.com/download


#### Intro to HEP

A set of introductory High Energy Physics notes relevant to the work in these tutorials is provided in the notes folder. These notes were produced with the help of Dr Andreas Korn and Dr Emily Nurse.

#### Intro to Collider Physics and ATLAS

Here are the slides for the talk you heard from CERN Physicist Dr Andrew bell.

#### ATLAS Cut-Based Analysis

The search for Higgs to bb is crucial to studying the Standard Model Higgs and understanding how the Higgs boson couples to quarks. In this tutorial you will be developing a cut based analysis on Monte Carlo generated ATLAS data to study the Higgs Boson decay to a pair of _b_-quarks.

The notebook for this section is titled _ATLAS Cut-Based Analysis_.


### ATLAS Machine Learning

As promised, we will be extending the ATLAS analysis to one that includes machine learning techniques. Specifically, Boosted Decision Trees. We will learn how machine learning algorithms can improve our sensitivity to signal by maximising the information extracted from data.

The notebook for this section is titled _ATLAS_NN._.
