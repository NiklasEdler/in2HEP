**Overview of the event.**

The task for the day is to develop the ATLAS H->bb analysis first using a cut based approach and then using a neural network. They will be completing the tasks on your machines using Jupyter Notebooks. There will be an introductory talk by ATLAS post-doc Andy Bell where he will give an overview of the Higgs to bb search at ATLAS. Then the students an hour on the cut based analysis

The participating students will be split into groups of 5 to complete the tasks for the day.

At some point during the day you will be asked to tell the students about your work and research in your groups and take questions.

**Teaching Methods and Pedagogy**

We would like to encourage more young people from disadvantaged background to engage with physics. Crucial to this is to remember that not everyone will have had the same amount of exposure to physics or science generally. Not everyone will feel as comfortable asking questions and some students, especially female students, may not feel as confident in the groups. Our goal is to ensure they learn the material whilst addressing some of these issues that inhibit learning.

* Regularly check if they understand what is going on. There is a very good ratio on the day so this will be fairly easy.

* Explain the problem and solution in simple terms/language and avoid jargon. This one is difficult because there are a lot of words that you will use regularly as a PhD student and are second nature to you but these students are only just hearing them for the first time.

* Although there is a competition in the event, the aim is to introduce them to AI and physics. So if your group learns loads about what you do, how neural networks work, and how we use machine learning in tech/society/science, that is a better outcome than if they win the prize. Try to explain what the layers in the neural network do and how the different architectures work.

### Speaking about your work (15 minutes)

The aim of the day is to give students a flavour of what doing physics is like. In this session, you should discuss within your group what kind of research work you do and how you are using or will use machine learning and data science.

Start by telling the group about your research. Where you do it, what it involves and what are the physics goals.

Give them opportunities to ask questions throughout and try to engage in a dialog or you will get stuck in a one-way conversation with an intimidated audience.

Note to male PhD students: this will sound obvious but don't mansplain your female peers' work to the students.
