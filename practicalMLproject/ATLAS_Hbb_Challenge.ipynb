    "# 1.  Identifying collisions containing Higgs bosons at the Large Hadron Collider\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary physics objectives of the Large Hadron Collider is to study the Higgs Boson and understand the process by which particles acquire mass. The Higgs Boson's decays channels along with the respective branching ratios are shown in the figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://physicsforme.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/higgs_decay.jpg\" width=\"400\" />\n",

    "In 2012 the Higgs Boson was <a href=\"https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2012-27/\">discovered</a> in the $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$ and $H\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4l$ decay channels. The plot below shows a clear excess of collisions (also referred to as events) over the background processes at around 125 GeV, when looking at the Higgs boson mass reconstructed using the four leptons, in the $H\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4l$ 'golden channel'. \n",

    "However, the Higgs Boson predominantly decays to a pair of $b$-quarks ($H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$), but it actually took till 2018 for it to be <a href=\"https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2018-04/\"> observed at $5\\sigma$ sensitivity</a> in this decay channel. This is because the discovery channels leave a clean signature in the detector that is easy to isolate making searches in the $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$ or $H\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4l$ favourable. However, as explaiend below, $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ searches have much larger and more complicated backgrounds, which necessiatates the use of complicated machine learning algorithms at many stages of the analysis to be able to isolate the small number of collisions containing $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ over the overwhelming number of collisions containing no Higgs boson (the background processes). This challenge will involve training a Neural Network to identify collisions containing $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ (a supervised classifier) using ATLAS simulated collision data, to maximise ATLAS's sensitivity to this vital Higgs decay channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Large background \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ process at the LHC has enourmous amount of background with final states that are the same as the signal i.e. two $b$-quarks ($b\\bar{b}$). The figure below shows the cross sections (the likelihood of producing a given process) for a Higgs boson compared to $b\\bar{b}$ at the LHC. In the LHC current operational energy, only around 1 in a trillion proton-proton collisions create a Higgs boson. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../docs/images/lhc_cross_sections.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, complicated techniques need to be deployed to identify the small amount of signal over the background processes that are several magnitudes larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jet Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, precisely measuring and distinguishing $b$-quarks from say $c$-quarks or light-flavour quarks is also challenging. When a pair of $b$-quarks is created in the ATLAS detector they go through a process known as hadronisation and form [jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMH3T05G\\_to). The jets must be identified as originating from b-quarks (b-jets) by a process known as <a href=\"https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/FTAG-2018-01/\">$b$-tagging</a>. This extra level of complexity along with the large background makes searches for $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ challenging. "
