Suggested tasks for the Higgs boson supervised classificaiton project

Baseline
- Produce optimised cut-based analysis using the di-jet mass as a discriminant to use as baseline and for comparison (shouldnâ€™t spend more than ~ 1 day on this)
- Produce optimised NN-based signal vs background supervised classifier:
	+ Number of nodes in layers
	+ Number of hidden layers
	+ Training parameters
	+ Activation functions
	+ Optimisation algorithms
 - Determine:
  + Improvement over a cut-based approach
  + If we have enough training statistics (vary number of input statistics separately for signal and background from 0 -> 100%, does it plateau?)
  + The importance of the input variables (remove one variable at a time and retrain, how much does the sensitivity degrade by?)
Extensions:
- Try automated hyper-parameter optimisation (Baysien, stochastic), compare to a grid search
- Train a multi-classifier or MVA cascade for the different backgrounds (V+bb, tt, diboson), how does this compare 
- Determine training uncertainty (how much does performance vary when re-training an identical configuration)
