    "## 1. $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ via Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms are one of the ways with which we create Artificial Intelligence. The distinguishing featuere of machine learning compared to usual programming is training. Instead of programming the steps to get to the solution to a problem we program a machine learning algorithm to be trained to learn the steps towards the desired solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the ATLAS $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ analysis, using machine learning allows us to extract information about the correlations between the different kinematic variables to improve discrimination between signal and background. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will build and train a Neural Network algorithm to classify $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ events instead of using sequential cuts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network model is loosely based on the human brain. A Neuron receives a number of input signals, these signals are then processed at the neuron which passes on a new signal (fires) to the next neuron only if a certain condition is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a collection of artificial neurons organised in layers (as shown in the image below) that connect together allowing the neural network to learn complexities and make sophisticated decisions. The artificial neurons work by simple multiplication between the input signals (variables) coming into the node and a set of weights. If the produce of this multiplication is above a certain threshold, the neuron fires! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Neural Network](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OH3gI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The neurons must be trained to process the signal appropriately so as to maximise the accuracy in decision making. To understand this, let's go back to the human brain analogy. Say you were teaching your younger sibling how to recognise numbers. You would repeatedly show them pictures of numbers and tell them which one is which. You might test their knowledge by giving them a new image and then seeing whether they recognised what digit it was. You might then praise them for getting it right and correct them if they got it wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons are trained in a similar way. To train a neural network to learn how to recognise handwritten digits we would give it thousands of images of labelled handwritten digits. It will pass these images through the network in the form of numbers between 0 and 1, compute the product between these inputs (the image in the form of numbers) and the weights at all neurons. The final product at the end of the  neural network will be used to reach a decision. The training process updates the weights such that the accuracy is maximised. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is similar to maximisation (or minimisation) problems you may have done in A-Level Maths using differentiation to find the minimum/maximum value of function. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this might sound a bit confusing! Don’t worry it is a lot to take in within a short space of time. Ask your mentors about anything you’re unsure about. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're now going to learn how to build and apply a neural network in Python using the Keras library. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Neural Networks in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for doing the $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ can be summarised with the following 6 steps:\n",

    "* Import libraries and load data.\n",

    "In this exercise, your mentors will guide you through a lot of the code that has already been written for you so that you can focus specifically on building the neural network. It is still valuable to understand what is going on so make sure you ask questions! "
